  <h3><code>DESCRIBE</code> Query</h3>
</header>

<p>
  The
  <code>DESCRIBE</code>
  query serves as a tool for data exploration. The exact behaviour of this query
  type depends on the implementation of the SPARQL engine you use, but in
  general it returns a graph containing any triples that include the resource
  being described. This query can also take a
  <code>WHERE</code>
  clause to describe one or multiple specific resource. An example of this query
  would be
</p>

<Yasgui @defaultQuery='
PREFIX mo: <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/>
DESCRIBE mo:MusicArtist
' @readOnly={{true}} />

<p>
  Note that in this case, the class
  <code>mo:MusicArtist</code>
  itself is being described.
</p>
<p>We can also describe a specific instance of the class
</p>

<Yasgui @defaultQuery='
PREFIX mo: <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/>
DESCRIBE ?artist
WHERE {
  ?artist a mo:MusicArtist .
}
LIMIT 1
' @readOnly={{true}} />

<p>
  This query will describe a single instance of a mo:MusicArtist and the output
  contains all triples where this instance appears.
</p>

<p>
  You might have noticed the new
  <code>LIMIT</code>
  syntax introduced in this last query. It's one of the query modifiers we'll
  talk about more in-depth later and it serves to limit the amount of triples
  you want to receive from the
  <code>WHERE</code>
  clause.
